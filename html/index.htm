		<h1>

			Art Metamorphosis

		</h1>

		<p>

			Art, the product of creative human activity in which materials are shaped or selected to 
			convey an idea, emotion, or visually interesting form. The word art can refer to the visual 
			arts, including painting, sculpture, architecture, photography, decorative arts, crafts, 
			and other visual works that combine materials or forms. We also use the word art in a more 
			general sense to encompass other forms of creative activity, such as dance, drama, and music, 
			or even to describe skill in almost any activity, such as “the art of bread making” or “the 
			art of travel.” 

		</p>

		<p>

			When people ask, “What is art?” or state that something “is not art,” they usually are not 
			seeking a philosophical definition but are instead expressing an opinion that a painting is 
			not realistic enough, that it is offensive, or that it does not use traditional materials. 
			Defining art too narrowly, or in a way that only affirms what we already believe, deprives us 
			of many delightful and thought-provoking experiences. An awareness of all the things that art
			can be should encourage us to enjoy many different types of art, or at least to wonder why we 
			value one type above another. 

		</p>
		
		<p>

			The skills exhibition will be enhances annually under the Art Workshop as part of the Presidents 
			Calendar of Activities of the organization. (Tagum City National High School)
